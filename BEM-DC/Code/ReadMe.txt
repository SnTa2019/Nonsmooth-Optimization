!*     Bundle enrichment method (BEM-DC) is an algorithm for solving     *
!*     nonsmooth difference of convex (DC) programming problems          *

!*     (last modified 28.07.2022).
!*     The code is partly based on the code snippets by Kaisa Joki       *
!*     and it uses a quadratic solver by Ladislav Luksan.                *

!*     The software is free for academic teaching and research           *
!*     purposes but we ask you to refer the appropriate references       *
