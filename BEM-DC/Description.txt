Bundle enrichment method (BEM-DC) is an algorithm for solving nonsmooth difference of convex (DC) programming problems. 
The novelty of the method consists of the dynamic management of the bundle. More specifically, a DC model, being the 
difference of two convex piecewise affine functions is formulated. The (global) minimization of the model is tackled 
by solving a set of convex problems whose cardinality depends on the number of linearizations adopted to approximate 
the second DC component function. The new bundle management policy distributes the information coming from previous 
iterations to separately model the DC components of the objective function. Such a distribution is driven by sign of 
linearization errors. If the displacement suggested by the model minimization provides no sufficient decrease of the 
objective function, then the temporary enrichment of the cutting plane approximation of just the first DC component 
function takes a place until either the termination of the algorithm is certified or a sufficient decrease is achieved. 
The most remarkable feature of the \DCPL is that it uses less subgradient evaluations of the second DC components than 
any other method. This feature makes the proposed method different from other methods.
