!*     The user provides:  
!*     nstarting : For single starting point press 1, for many starting points press 2
!*     npoint    : Number of starting points; npoint = 1 for single starting point and 
!*                 npoint = 10 for 10 randomly generated points, but could vary. 
!*                 Input file for 10 starting points in our case is "startingpoints.tex".
